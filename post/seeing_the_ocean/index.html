We passed through the belly of the mountains all the way to the southern tip of the cape.
I think this is the first time I saw such a wild sea, gulping clouds and sea breeze, manipulating sun and rain, wild and proud, without any trace of human domestication, no sand or pebbles to be found, only dark reefs barely marking the boundary between sea and land, like a monk in silent meditation, bearing the low roar of the waves leaping, crashing, and then breaking on top of the skull, which is intimidating anyone who tries to intimate with it with white fragments. The back of the whale seems to appear at the junction of the sky and the sea in the next moment. The smell of the sea is pure and clean, and the tiny particles that roll into the nose spread the will of an ancient body of water: the sea does not need a declaration, does not need an oracle, and cannot be interpreted. Or maybe the sea itself is an oracle.

I think that is true. I have experienced many moments in the past year when my own experience has been shattered, while some have been reorganized, others still floating in a vacuum, pushed and shoved by the world as much as I am. The powerlessness and the hypocrisy of words constantly reveal my weaknesses, making me weary and miserable, but I could feel that the texture of my heart has become stronger &ndash; having seen the constellations in the bright night sky and such a clear and intense sea, there is indeed nothing to be afraid of anymore.</p></section><section><footer class=page-footer><hr><div class=previous-post style=display:inline-block><a class=link-reverse href="http://pippimotta.github.io/post/zelda/?ref=footer">« The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild as a site...</a></div><div class=next-post , style=display:inline-block;float:right><a class=link-reverse href="http://pippimotta.github.io/post/test_ci/?ref=footer">Let's see whether this ci works »</a></div><ul class=page-footer-menu><li><a href=https://github.com/pippimotta><i class='fab fa-github'></i></a></li><li><a href=https://g0v.social/@pippimotta><i class='fab fa-mastodon'></i></a></li><li><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/lingyi-z/><i class='fab fa-linkedin'></i></a></li><li><a href=mailto:lingyizh84@gmail.com><i class='far fa-envelope'></i></a></li></ul><div class=credits><p class=copyright>&copy; 2023
