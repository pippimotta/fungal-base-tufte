It involves the use of public key and private key encryption, as well as the certification authority.
General idea: Any message encrypted w/ Kinoko&amp;rsquo;s public key can only be decrypted with Kinoko&amp;rsquo;s private key Any one with access to Kinoko&amp;rsquo;s public key can verify that a message could only have been created by someone to Kinoko&amp;rsquo;s private key A message encrypted with Public key is used for secrecy (as it could be only decrypted by private key) A message encrypted with Private key is used for authentication (a bit tricky but let&amp;rsquo;s say who holds Kinoko&amp;rsquo;s private key can be verified as Kinoko (kinoko is key itself &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; key-no-koü§°) ) General process: Source: How does HTTPS work?</description></item><item><title>Cheat Sheet for self introduction</title><link>http://pippimotta.github.io/post/self_intro_cheatsheet/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://pippimotta.github.io/post/self_intro_cheatsheet/</guid><description>This is just the longer version of about &amp;ndash; I am not good at self-introduction, and feel absolutely confused at 80% of the circumstance if I am required to do one. However, I happen to have a slightly complicated story to tell. So I decide to write this cheat sheet to see whether this can make things easier. I am trying to make it FAQ-like cuz I&amp;rsquo;m kind of being keen on guessing people&amp;rsquo;s questions (bad habit) (^^)</description></item><item><title>For 2022</title><link>http://pippimotta.github.io/post/fungal_2022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://pippimotta.github.io/post/fungal_2022/</guid><description>&lt;p>Can&amp;rsquo;t believe I am writing annual summary one day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is my 4th winter away from home (and actually the best?) since 2019. Although the world does not show any evidence of change for the better, at least I am growing more robust.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Let's see whether this ci works</title><link>http://pippimotta.github.io/post/test_ci/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://pippimotta.github.io/post/test_ci/</guid><description>&lt;p>It worksÔºÅ(‚óé_‚óé;)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>‰ª§Âíå‰∏âÂπ¥‰∏âÊúàÂçÅ‰∏âÊó•„ÄÅÊµ∑„ÇíË¶ã„Å´Ë°å„Åè</title><link>http://pippimotta.github.io/post/seeing_the_ocean/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://pippimotta.github.io/post/seeing_the_ocean/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last Saturday, I went on my first road trip with Capybara. We passed through the belly of the mountains all the way to the southern tip of the cape.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think this is the first time I saw such a wild sea, gulping clouds and sea breeze, manipulating sun and rain, wild and proud, without any trace of human domestication, no sand or pebbles to be found, only dark reefs barely marking the boundary between sea and land, like a monk in silent meditation, bearing the low roar of the waves leaping, crashing, and then breaking on top of the skull, which is intimidating anyone who tries to intimate with it with white fragments. The back of the whale seems to appear at the junction of the sky and the sea in the next moment. The smell of the sea is pure and clean, and the tiny particles that roll into the nose spread the will of an ancient body of water: the sea does not need a declaration, does not need an oracle, and cannot be interpreted. Or maybe the sea itself is an oracle.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild as a site of knowledge</title><link>http://pippimotta.github.io/post/zelda/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://pippimotta.github.io/post/zelda/</guid><description>&lt;p>It seems hard to add any more compliments to &lt;em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em>. This action-adventure game issued in March 2017, developed and published by Nintendo won the IGN‚Äôs Game of the Year.
It is described as ‚Äúevocative, exhilarating and a masterclass in open-world design‚Äù and the milestone in the game history. The game, just as its tile indicated, creates a wild and vast area ‚Äìthe land of &lt;em>Hyrule&lt;/em> for the players, which hides hundreds of puzzles and wonder to be found.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hiking</title><link>http://pippimotta.github.io/post/mountain_climbing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://pippimotta.github.io/post/mountain_climbing/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today I went to climb the mountain again! Heiligenberg is a great moutain, with few people and lots of plants and insects. I saw hops, young and premature acorns, hidden mosses and fern empires, and inky blue gastropod beetles, who especially love to sunbathe and are happy to hobble across the mountain and put their lives under the pedestrians&amp;rsquo; shoes and bicycle wheels. One part of the road was densely covered with shiny metallic fragments of sheath wings, which was sad to see. I also ran into a Magcargo who was out walking at dusk on a clear day, as well as other goose-yellow mushrooms.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
