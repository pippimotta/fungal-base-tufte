Heiligenberg is a great moutain, with few people and lots of plants and insects. I saw hops, young and premature acorns, hidden mosses and fern empires, and inky blue gastropod beetles, who especially love to sunbathe and are happy to hobble across the mountain and put their lives under the soles of pedestrians&rsquo; shoes and bicycle wheels. One part of the road was densely covered with shiny metallic fragments of sheath wings, which was sad to see. I also ran into a Magcargo who was out walking at dusk on a clear day, as well as other goose-yellow mushrooms.</p><p>Then I climbed all the way to the monastery site. The weather was exceptionally good, the sky was clear, and the different concentrations of blue settled into layers, making me want to coin a new term &ldquo;sky rock&rdquo;.</p><p><img src=/images/sky_rock.jpg alt></p><p>I admired the art of piling stones (the artist was probably Korok), visited the young autumn locusts and the strawberries in the corner (and the bellybutton of the tree!)</p><p><img src=/images/locust.jpg alt></p><p>As the sun was setting, I saw dandelions swirling into the <em>Abendrot</em> at a near-still speed, their fine fluff turning crimson, and the wind picking up to blow away the gnarled dreams of old tree roots. The autumn cricket has begun to sing in parts, and the ripe currants roll down into the crevices of leaves and soil. The last surprise was the discovery of a beer bottle as high as my index finger left by a gnome on the way down. And I supposed that the birds were also invited to join the feast.</p><p>The only regret was that I didn&rsquo;t meet any squirrels and no birds were as enthusiastic as the Amsterdam crows to meet my poor whistle (The birds of Heidelberg are so heartless! Except for eating, the only thing they know is pooping).</p></section><script src=https://utteranc.es/client.js repo=pippimotta/pippimotta.github.io issue-term=title theme=github-light crossorigin=anonymous async></script><section><footer class=page-footer><hr><div class=previous-post style=display:inline-block><a class=link-reverse href="http://pippimotta.github.io/about/?ref=footer">«</a></div><div class=next-post , style=display:inline-block;float:right><a class=link-reverse href="http://pippimotta.github.io/post/zelda/?ref=footer">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild as a site... »</a></div><ul class=page-footer-menu><li><a href=https://github.com/pippimotta><i class='fab fa-github'></i></a></li><li><a href=https://g0v.social/@pippimotta><i class='fab fa-mastodon'></i></a></li><li><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/lingyi-z/><i class='fab fa-linkedin'></i></a></li><li><a href=mailto:lingyizh84@gmail.com><i class='far fa-envelope'></i></a></li></ul><div class=credits><p class=copyright>&copy; 2023
