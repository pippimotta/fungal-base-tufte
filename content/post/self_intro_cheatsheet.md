This is just the longer version of _about_ -- I am not good at self-introduction, and feel absolutely confused at 80% of the circumstance if I am required to do one. However, I happen to have a slightly complicated story to tell. So I decide to write this cheat sheet to see whether this can make things easier. I am trying to make it FAQ-like cuz I'm kind of being keen on guessing people's questions (bad habit) (^^)

**What did you study in school?**

During my undergraduate age, I learned sociology because the 18-year-old-version me was quite obsessed in figuring out the principles of human society and immersing myself in the wonderful theories which seemed to be powerful enough to explain everything. In my incomplete master program, I went a bit into transcultural studies (tbh I'm withholding my opinions for this discipline for now), which could be understood as a _union_ of social sciences and humanities, aiming to address the challenges posed by global connectivity ^#^&^$#*(@#&*(%$&Z%(&)^%#%.{{<sidenote>}} referring to [the handout of that program](https://www.cats.bun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/jdts/) {{</sidenote>}}

**What did those things bring to you?**

To be honest, they brought me more pain than joy, which partly explains why I run away from those fields. However, I do not regret the fact that I received my sociological training at the stage where I was about to explore the broader world. The methodology I've learned in sociology keeps promting me to pay attention to human condition and more possibilities, as well as the significance of empathy, imagination of sociology and the power of _speech and action_.{{<sidenote>}}If you would like to know more about this part, please do have a check of Hannah Arendt's [The Human Condition](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/127227.The_Human_Condition) which fuelled me with some meta thoughts about activities, labour, public realm and life.{{</sidenote>}}

**Why don't you learn those things anymore?**

Because I find something more interesting to do. I still admire the sparks of _speculation_, despite the fact that I was struggling with the sense of fragementation and meaninglessness from 2019 or earlier. And I finally realized that the things I am good at are not neccessarily the things I am really into, and vice versa. I am most (and only) productive when I am driven by my own curiosity. Also, because of my ADHD (let's call it nureodiversity later), I need the instant feedback to keep my level of dopamine at a stable level and myself motivated. Dabbling in the world of theories is good, but not good with the requirements/deadline of output (i.e. essays).

-----Self introduction is exhausting*(´ཀ`」 ∠)* ------

**So how did you start programming? / What makes you want to be a software engineer?**

I guess this question is easier for me to answer if it is transformed into the other way -- what blocked me from getting interested in computer/programming in the previous 24 years of my life.

The answer are 1. awful tutorial & teacher 2. prevailed atmosphere of suppressing girls from learning natural science (or related) (AKA gate-keeping). This topic could be actually expanded into another long article so I decide to skip it here. (Maybe one day I will work on that in detail)
