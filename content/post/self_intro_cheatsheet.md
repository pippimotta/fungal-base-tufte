This is just the longer version of *about* -- I am not good at self-introduction, and feel absolutely confused at 80% of the circumstance if I am required to do one. However, I happen to have a slightly complicated story to tell. So I decide to write this cheat sheet to see whether this can make things easier. I am trying to make it FAQ-like cuz I kind of being keen on guessing people's questions (bad habit) (^^)
