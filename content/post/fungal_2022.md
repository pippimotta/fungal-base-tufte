Can't believe I am writing annual summary one day.

This is my 4th winter away from home (and actually the best?) since 2019. Although the world does not show any evidence of change for the better, at least I am growing more robust.

(ヤッハリ annual summary is a pain, スキップしよう)

Overall, the kindness I received this year has far exceeded the sum of past few years, with the help of which, I become finally comfortable and relaxed with myself, and get to know how to live my life without self-sabotage as I no longer have to fight against humiliation. And I finally come to realize that I could make something and be liked by a lot of people without *masking* {{<sidenote>}}basically pretending to be a neurotypical person{{</sidenote>}}-- I could make mistakes, I could ask for help, I could stumble and fall, I could act socially awkward, but none of that mattered. I am no longer that kid crying in learned helplessness.

Also, the feeling of regaining the ability to learn is just great and feeling that puzzles of knowledge are being resolved can actually be described as an ecstasy. I hope there could be more moments like that in the new year.

Last year I've answered many questions about myself, and I hope I can answer more questions about the world(?) this year.

明けましておめでとう！(⁎⁍̴̛ᴗ⁍̴̛⁎)
