## Introduction

It seems hard to add any more compliments to *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*. This action-adventure game issued in March 2017, developed and published by Nintendo won the IGN’s Game of the Year.
<!--more-->
It is described as “evocative, exhilarating and a masterclass in open-world design” and the milestone in the game history. The game, just as its tile indicated, creates a wild and vast area –the land of *Hyrule* for the players, which hides hundreds of puzzles and wonder to be found.

*Open-world* refers to the game mechanic as well as the tangible space that the avatar of player can freely explore, which serves as the bridge between two worlds: reality and game reality. On the one hand, open-world video games rely on real-life concepts which offer players with senses of familiarity, immersion, detail, and depth inside their alien environments (Toups et.al 2019). On the other hand, there are less geographically and mechanically restraints like invisible walls or linear level challenges, so that the players can proceed the game as they wish –to this extent, the player and the role he is manipulating could never be closer to each other. Freedom and exploration, the two main features which reveal the core attraction of open-world games are fully displayed in BotW, as complimented by the committee of IGN, “It presents a wonderful sandbox full of mystery, dangling dozens upon dozens of tantalizing things in front of you that just beg to be explored.”

To what extent that open-world video games can be seen as the refraction of the real world? Meanwhile, how should we view a game? Is it a form of entertainment, an avant-garde form of art, or a vehicle of emotion, experience and ethics? Furthermore, as a product of modernity, to what extent can we trace the process of knowledge production in this open-world game, for example, the theoretical metaphor rooted in the mechanics and the narratives of the game? And what kind of knowledge can we obtain via manipulating our avatar, *Link*, while playing? To what extent does the knowledge generated in BotW world resonate with that in real world and bring us new illuminations?

In this article, I attempt to answer the questions above through the discussion of a serial of themes based on my own playing experience, other’s playing experience, reviews, comments and the interviews on producers which are available online and offline, including textual and visual.

## Wild
Wilderness serves as the canvas of the entire game –after *Link* wake from the *Shrine of Resurrection* and came through the dark long corridor, being guided by the only gleam of light, he climbed cross the stone wall and came out of the shrine. It is the vivid field where tall grass sways with the tender breeze, while the birds are making pleasant chirping and butterflies dancing above the blooming flowers. With the automatic moving of the angle, more details of the *Hyrule* world entered into the player’s view: The volcano is spewing clouds of smoke in the distance, the snow-capped mountains loom in silhouette against the clouds. When *Link* ran toward a corner of the protruding cliff, facing the sun, he seized the panoramic view of the *Great Plateau*.

As for the design of Wild, at least for the topography, Nintendo does not set too many fiction elements –all the vegetation, stones, ponds, hills in the game are close to their realistic appearance with little animation transformation. Therefore, the wild is not completely strange to players, but simulating an environment which fits the player’s perception of the wilderness. The initiate inspiration to create the Zelda game can be traced in Miyamoto’s childhood experience of “exploring forests and caves, secret doors and paths” as he indicated in an interview in 2016. Therefore, the concept of wild is no longer limited as the stage for the game, but further signifies an entire cognitive and action system derived from the human interaction with wild.

When the player switches the perspective and manipulates *Link* to look down, he could easily notice the apple tree located at the entrance of the path under which the *Hylian Shroom* is sparkling to remind the player that it is pickable. After the player put the Shroom into bag, he naturally notices that the apples above are sparkling as well –but how to get them? He pushes the lever up to see whether it is possible to climb the tree and surprisingly find it does work. Actually, the climbing system is one of the most important mechanics in the game system. It implies a crucial axiom of the game: every space that come into view is approachable. While the knowledge of climbing is acquired by players, the basic tone of exploration in the wild is set. *Link* is expected to discover every inch of **Hyrule** world with his feet and hands, although he will learn to tame and ride the wild horses in the middle stage of playing. A number of chests of treasure, *Korok* seeds{{<sidenote>}} Korok is forest spirit, and its seed is a collectable element which can be used to expand the capacity of weapons.{{</sidenote>}}, and hidden shrines are arranged where can only be reached by climbing to encourage player to adopt the original method to conduct adventure. 

On the other hand, the designers endeavoured to develop an extraordinary exquisite climbing system –it works on almost any surface and slopes, from trees to snow mountains and castles, while the player must estimate the consuming of stamina and look for the landing spot in case *Link* falls from the height. The knowledge of climbing is gradually refined and transformed into a skill after the primary practicing, which keeps reminding the player that the original instincts of physical exploration when facing the wilderness is precisely a part of the core gameplay.

Back to *Link*’s journey, after he grabbed the first apple, he heard an old man calling -the first NPC he met was sitting near the bonfire and baking the apple, from which *Link* obtained the second knowledge from the wild: the usage of fire. The old man told *Link* that the ingredients collected from the wild can be roasted over a fire to increase more “hearts” (HP), which is also consistent with the natural rules of wild as we always perceive. However, baking food is just one of a dozen usage of the fire. In the following first fight with *Bokoblins*, the player will notice that the wooden weapon used by these pig-like monsters can be set ablaze when it approaches the fire. Furthermore, the normal wooden arrow through a fire will turns into a fire-arrow, which can cause a sizeable explosion if there is a TNT-like barrel around. When the player tries to ignite the grass with a torch, he will gladly find that the burning lawn creates an updraft which enables him to open the paraglider and get rid of the group attack of *Bokoblins*.

Aside from the usage of fire, the designers also transplanted several other natural rules into the wild in game, which are incredibly familiar like the basic scientific knowledge in children’s book, and yet extraordinary amazing that one cannot believe it is simply reprinted in a video game. For instance, thundering weather sometimes occurs during the adventure, and the lightning from the gloomy sky will set the grass on fire. Moreover, if *Link* is carrying any weapon made by metal, it is highly possible that he will be hit by the lightning just because metal conducts electricity. And when *Link* tries to climb slopes on a rainy day, he will be using more “stamina” than sunny days and slip from time to time.

The first few hours on the *Great Plateau* are challenging, as the player has to understand how this world of wilderness functions and endeavour to survive. *Link* has to face the same tough situation as Robinson did on his desert island, since the wild appears as an overwhelming and dominant existence. Yet, for the player who is sitting in front of the screen, the wild inside the screen represents a paradoxical and obscure land: it is unpredictable and oppressive, since almost every uncertain threat (e.g. *Bokoblins*, wolves, rolling stones, lightening) hiding in it can easily deprive his avatar’s “life”, given the situation that *Link* only gets three “hearts” at the beginning. In another aspect, facing the wild, the player does not feel completely helpless because the interaction with natural elements seems to be driven in line with his cognitive scheme on the “wild” outside the screen. In this way, the wild the player is going through becomes a less alien existence because his physical/chemical experience from realistic world is intertwined with his playing experience in the virtual wild.

It is fair to say that the wild in the game is a simplified wild, because it is nothing more than an assembly of data. In other words, it is undeniable that the trace of artificiality has been always concealed in the depth of the wild the player is experiencing. However, it is also intriguing to observe how the sentiment of “youth and innocence” referred to Cosgrove (2008:114) is embedded in the virtual and artificial wild: climbing points to the most direct way of exploration without any instruction, which brings the player back to infancy period driven by intuition; the basic laws of nature physics/chemistry running parallel to real world serves as the support for the constant bursts of surprises and wonders during the first hours of playing –"If you think something should work, it usually does”(Otero 2020). 

![Figure 2: Link climbing the hill](/images/map-interface.jpeg)
{{< figure

>}}

Inevitably, the process articulated by Fox (2009) that human cognition interacts with land and transforms it into landscape is also reflected along with the progressing of the game: as *Link* lights up the tower of an unexplored area, the surrounding map information will be displayed on Shekiah Slate --the built-in interface main item with comprehensive functions. A point-to-point reflective relationship between the wild and the map is gradually established. The hills are depicted as contour lines, while the forest and ponds are condensed into dark or shallow blocks of colour. The player is even allowed to make his own marks on the map with light bars and pins. The unknown space, which was signified by glittering dots on *Shekiah Slate*, is substituted by concrete place –a certain terrain with shrines to challenge and Bokoblin camps to conquer. Clues are given for *Link*’s further navigation, and the unknown wilderness will eventually recede, and be replaced by the realm of the durable known that is destined to be reached, through which the player’s knowledge of the wild is polished and practiced.

The coexistence of wild and its map, which could also be understood as inter-referential, implies the dialectic about boundaries: Man’s position in the world is defined by the fact that in every dimension of his being and his behaviour he stands at every moment between two boundaries (Simmel 1971:353). The map makes the player aware of his location and his way of orientation, convincing him the “space of our world” is not infinite (Tester 1993:7). However, when the world beyond boundaries is exhausted little by little, existential crisis begins to contest the ultimate goal of exploration. On one hand, the player manipulates *Link* to acquire the knowledge of the wild with all his heart. On the other hand, the more boundaries he crosses to witness more wonders and the wider world, the less surprise he will gain from it. In the end, the player can only sentimentally realize that the happiest moment of all is when he is completely ignorant of the scale of wilderness, when he feels at ease to surrender all his cognition to the Oracle, to the darkness and campfire, to the high grass and the earth. 

## Ethic
The entire series of Zelda games is constructed on the storyline with strong ethical tone, and BotW is no exception –the whole *Hyrule* world had been suffering from the antagonist *Calamity Ganon* since 100 years ago; Princess *Zelda* left herself at the fallen castle to fight against Ganon alone; *Link*, the last warrior and knight of *Hyrule Kingdom* who awakens after a hundred years of slumber, is given the mission to rescue the princess and bring peace back to the land. The sacred artifact that is central to the narrative of series, *Triforce*, symbolizes three main traits: wisdom, power and courage. Bolano (2020) points out that the description of the *Triforce* shares several similarities to Aristotle’s conception of virtue ethics which underlines human good as acting in accordance with virtue, while people must become virtuous through continuous practice and habituation. The process of *Link*’s cultivating virtues is embodied throughout the game: the wisdom is developed by solving the puzzles of the shrines; the power is developed by obtaining advanced weapons and techniques to combat against monsters; the courage is developed by challenging more dangerous foes. 

Of the three virtues, courage is most likely to resonate with the player as a human in reality, since the puzzles could be solved in tricky ways and power is just a superposition of numbers. Except for the ultimate Boss *Ganon*, the toughest enemy in the game is *Lynel* –a centaur-like monster with frightening and aggressive figure–tall body, perfect muscle lines and powerful limbs wielding horrifying metal weapons. It is noteworthy that *Lynel* just appears at the early stage of the main mission line for once, and the player does not actually have to defeat it, just sneak up behind it and pick up some arrows. Unfortunately, *Lynel* is alert enough to spot the thin and frail *Link*, and that is when the player experiences the first instant “death” caused by overwhelming power. 

Despite the numerous guidelines available online to teach players how to combat against *Lynel* with the techniques of *bullet time* {{<sidenote>}}Bullet time is a bonus effect triggered by perfect dodging which enables Link to give multiple attacks.{{</sidenote>}}and *shield parry*{{<sidenote>}}Shield parry is using the shield to bounce back enemy attack at the moment it is launched.{{</sidenote>}}, as long as the player is still shocked by the oppressive feeling when *Lynel* shakes the land, all the theoretical knowledge taken from the guideline will go stuck –repeated mistakes happen all the time and *Link* gets beat down over and again. But after experiencing a certain number of failures, there is always a moment that the player suddenly does not feel afraid, as the player concentrates on applying the techniques into the battle, carefully observes the motion of *Lynel* to find its flaws. After a few waves of counterattack, the player will find in surprise that the beast falls down, roared and crumbled to ashes. And that moment is when courage is awakened –not only the courage that *Link* symbolizes, but also the character developed by the players themselves: courage grown from countless adversities to fight absolute power. The designers intend to place all 22 *Lynels* in the remote sites through the *Hyrule* world, more or less implying the expectation that players could write their own odes of courage, through which they could embrace their intrinsic coherence with *Link* by crossing two mountains deliberately to challenge a *Lynel*.

If we understand the ethics from a more general meaning, as a way of interaction in the life and world, through BotW we could further investigate how player acts as an ethical agent in *Hyrule* world (Sicart 2011). The indispensable part of the interaction is NPC (non-player character), namely the stagecoach owners, foot traders, travellers, villagers etc, who are constructed in an extremely vivid way in BotW. Unlike NPCs in other games which behave like highly programmed functional roles to give out missions and rewards, the NPCs in BotW are rather individualized. For instance, in *Hateno Village* lives a shy girl called Sophie who always stands in the corner. Even if the player tries talking to her, she is still unwilling to tell her story. However, her father has a very different personality –the outgoing and talkative owner of the clothes shop will show you around *Hateno Village* and tell you all local customs. It is through such interaction that the player perceives himself as a normal visitor instead of a superior ruler. Another impressive side-request is to sneak after a guard in *Kakariko Village*, from which the player find out the tragic tale of this single father of two little girls: he used to be a member of *Yiga* but fell in love with a girl of *Kakariko*.{{<sidenote>}}Yiga is a villain group who worships Calamity Ganon{{</sidenote>}} He determined to leave *Yiga* and start a new life with his beloved. However, *Yiga* murdered his wife and threatened him with his daughters’ lives to force him steal the heirloom of the village. Helping the guard defeating the *Yiga* member, a genuine pleasure fills the player’s heart, like he is actually the chivalrous warrior himself.

Having conversations with different NPCs, the players become aware that they are more like human with subjectivity instead of character. Mok (2018) emphasizes, what is more valuable is that such process is not plot-driven, but highly depending on random encounter –from the little mermaid who asks *Link* to help her deliver the letter to her destined love, to the introvert traveller who invites *Link* to witness his confession, each encounter appears as episodic and completely occasional, just scattering like pearls on the path of *Link*’s wandering, thereby altering the epistemological structure of the player, the subject behind the screen.{{<sidenote>}}These side requests are not remarked on the map, which requires the player to discover.{{</sidenote>}} The player identifies himself no longer as outsider detached from this world, but just an ordinary wanderer walking here and now, being touched by each impressive encounter and trying to record them. Mok (2018) concludes the ethics based on encounter as “a purely present ethic”, neither concerning the commitment to the past nor pointing to the consequence of future. The player consolidates his adherence to this unique ethic system as well, dwelling poetically in the wild, and even actively refuses to head forward the main story line. *Triforce* represents the fixed ethical orientation inherited from the previous work, while BotW manages to construct a ubiquitous ethical fulcrum over the *Hyrule* land. In this way, the player gets to know that he does not have to dedicate himself to fulfil the ultimate ethical purpose –defeating *Ganon* and saving the princess. By initiating his own adventure stories and being emotionally attached with the people thriving in this post-apocalyptic land, he emancipates himself from the existed framework of assimilation that points to the stipulated ending.

## Paradox
Actually, the paradoxes have been already touched upon in two sections above: from the dialectical relation between map and wilderness to the conflict between the urgent ultimate goal and *Link*’s roaming play. In this part, I am not attempting to solve the paradoxes I observe but trying to display their intrinsic tension.

First is the technology. Coincidently, the dilemma of technology is reflected both in the game world and the real world. On the one hand, the *Guardians* created by *Hylian* technicians to defend the kingdom were contaminated by *Ganon* and transformed into tough enemies to restrict human’s activities from time to time, which serves as an apt metaphor of modernity: Technology is the material proof of the connection of the human to a linear time, sparking with the radiance of progress (Tester 1993:85).But the products of technology made by man will eventually manipulate man himself –technology continues long (in a negative way) after its justifications and legitimations have been transcended (Tester 1993:85). On the other hand, we have to admit that the game we are playing, this exquisite sandbox is also a product of technology, at least from the dimension of ontology –absurdity grows from every corner of the wild world from insects to flowers and brings an assertive paradox: the thrilling wild that fascinates us is the second nature created by artificiality. When technology has taken on some qualities which were previously entitled to God or Nature, it becomes self-animated entity to simulate nature, design nature and reduce nature into a standing-reserve (Tester 1993:85). Just as the vast wild land is appropriated to be used as the filler of the game to provide pleasure for player, we cannot help questioning in a confused way: why on earth is the meaning for us to seek for wilderness in a game? Or, in other words, is technology the inevitable destination after the natural artifice is deconstructed? 

Interestingly, the answer to the question above is somehow hidden in the open-world game itself. Heidegger (1993:209) defines enframing *(Ge-stell)* as the essence of modern technology, and through enframing, meanings are imposed upon things, while ‘man’ are encouraged and required to perform certain activities. Another implication that is rooted at heart of modernity is the futurity opened up by enframing, which also creates the pilgrim-like identities that defines the single destiny of future. (Tester 1993:95-97). However, it is precisely through *Link*’s wandering that the conventional meaning of “playing” is gradually dissolved. Although the high degree of freedom heavily depends on the technology (game engine), *Link*’s rejection of his well-ordained fate enables him to distance himself from that single future and identity. 

![Figure 6: The Guardian](/images/guardian.png)
{{< figure
caption="Figure 6: The Guardian."
>}}

Nevertheless, the fairy-tale-style practices that the player cope with technology results in *ludonarrative dissonance* –a contradiction and inconsistency between the mechanism and the narrative of the game. Just as I discussed in the section of Ethics, *Link* is destined by the narrative to play a role of hero to defeat Ganon (a future which has been set), but the mechanism is always encouraging the player to immerse in the present and distract them from the main request, and the player himself actually enjoy it. This is how the abyss of meaning emerges: *Link* was expected to draw his Master Sword and rush towards his one and only fate, but only the experience at the fork paths makes sense to him. The request raised by the old King of *Hyrule* at beginning of the game --saving *Zelda* signifies a narrative of a single linearity Linking past, present and future (Tester 1993: 120). Yet such narrative can never be completed because *Link* is always endeavouring to transcend his own identity by indulging himself in the endless wilderness wandering. In fact, the meaninglessness is even exacerbated by the game set after beating off *Ganon*, as everything returns to the same as before the battle after the ending animation and the list of staff, except for the additional asterisk to the player’s archive. It is likely that the player manipulates *Link* back to his journey to explore all the sites he has not approached before, which to some extent provides him with meaning until his enthusiasm is exhausted. However, the worst consequence is that he throws himself back to the mechanical technology (e.g. using game mechanism to obtain more money and rare material or items in the game) to achieve a certain immortality, as dozens of Youtubers indicated on their own channels to teach others how to get as many rupees as possible in short time.{{<sidenote>}}Rupee is the currency in BotW.{{</sidenote>}} The rehumanized *Link* is reified again{{<sidenote>}}“Rehumanize” refers to the unique emotional connection/experience between the player and his Avatar, as implied by the name of protagonist Link, I use this word to reflect on Heidegger’s argument about the danger on humanity imposed by enframing (Heidegger 1993:309). {{</sidenote>}}, using endless repetition to avoid the abyss of meaning and the collapse of future, in which another metaphor of post-modernity lies: responsibility for future without the inevitability of future (Tester 1993:124-126).

## Conclusion
In this article, I have tried to examine how an excellent open-world game serves as site of knowledge by sorting out a few topics I come up with during my own playing. I find that the knowledge generated in virtual world could mirror its counterpart in reality: wild, as the canvas and the core mechanism of the game, triggers the intuitive exploration desire of the player in collaboration with the well-designed climbing system and physics/chemistry engine. The knowledge of wild is constructed within the cognition scheme through consistent positive interaction, while the cross-referential relationship between map and wild brings query to the dialectics of boundaries. The discussion on ethic sheds light on the source of the sense of immersion –the player develops courage in line with his avatar by polishing his knowledge of combating with powerful foes, thus cultivating the virtue vicariously with *Link*. The occasional encounter with the NPCs who are infused with humanized characteristics constitutes the ethical fulcrum of *Hyrule* land and changes the epistemological structure of player. In fact, it is the unique ethical dimension of the game that makes dismantling the dilemma of technology possible. However, the ludonarrative dissonance exposes a corner on abyss of meaning that is dormant in the fabric of open-world game, casting reflection on the core myth of modernity/post-modernity.

## Afterword
I personally regard BotW as a fascinating artwork which brought a precious journey of over 200 hours. Aside from the pure aesthetic experience, I am more impressed by the enlightening moments when flashing sentiment encounters with the flame of contemplation during my wandering –this partly drives me to choose BotW as the topic of this essay. And I still feel I have a lot of themes to look further into, such as nostalgia, solitude, memory, ruins. Considering the limitation of space and my capacity, I cannot write out them all but I still want to quote a short paragraph from the journal I wrote after the first 80 hours of playing as my own tribute to this masterpiece:

> It is strange that an extreme introvert like me always holds an urge to talk to every traveller who passes by with a donkey and a pot on his back during my roaming in *Hyrule*, even though I know there are bad guys from *Yiga*. This is probably because that every evening with sunset is so magnificent, with volcanos spewing their afterglow, flocks of birds streaking across the sky, clouds casting large shadows and some towers being light while some being dark. I could not digest the immense and magnificent solitude without talking to anyone.
