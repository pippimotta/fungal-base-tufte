Hello, this is pippimottaüçÑ.

I'm currently learning to be a backend engineer.{{< sidenote "sn-example" >}}If you happen to be curious about the reason for this part, please have a look of my self-introduction cheat sheet(which hasn't been written:){{< /sidenote >}} I like figuring out the principles of things and explaining them in a clear way, through which the transcending harmony of self-consistent logic could come to forth.

What I'm trying to do more: keeping my dopamine at a stable level, being wary of structive inequality,  exploring the potential of cyber anarchism, discovering mushrooms in the gap of capitalist world. {{< sidenote "sn-example" >}}Referring to *[The Mushroom at the End of the World: On the Possibility of Life in Capitalist Ruins](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691220550/the-mushroom-at-the-end-of-the-world)*{{< /sidenote >}}

What I'm trying to avoid: inaccurate definition, overdosement of vocabulary and theory, ecstasy triggered by dramatic pain, meetings that could've been emails, satisfying with being a perpetual layman.
