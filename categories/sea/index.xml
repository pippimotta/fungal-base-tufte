We passed through the belly of the mountains all the way to the southern tip of the cape.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think this is the first time I saw such a wild sea, gulping clouds and sea breeze, manipulating sun and rain, wild and proud, without any trace of human domestication, no sand or pebbles to be found, only dark reefs barely marking the boundary between sea and land, like a monk in silent meditation, bearing the low roar of the waves leaping, crashing, and then breaking on top of the skull, which is intimidating anyone who tries to intimate with it with white fragments. The back of the whale seems to appear at the junction of the sky and the sea in the next moment. The smell of the sea is pure and clean, and the tiny particles that roll into the nose spread the will of an ancient body of water: the sea does not need a declaration, does not need an oracle, and cannot be interpreted. Or maybe the sea itself is an oracle.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
