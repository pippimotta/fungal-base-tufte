This action-adventure game issued in March 2017, developed and published by Nintendo won the IGN’s Game of the Year.
It is described as “evocative, exhilarating and a masterclass in open-world design” and the milestone in the game history. The game, just as its tile indicated, creates a wild and vast area –the land of &lt;em>Hyrule&lt;/em> for the players, which hides hundreds of puzzles and wonder to be found.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hiking</title><link>http://pippimotta.github.io/post/mountain_climbing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://pippimotta.github.io/post/mountain_climbing/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today I went to climb the mountain again! Heiligenberg is a great moutain, with few people and lots of plants and insects. I saw hops, young and premature acorns, hidden mosses and fern empires, and inky blue gastropod beetles, who especially love to sunbathe and are happy to hobble across the mountain and put their lives under the soles of pedestrians&amp;rsquo; shoes and bicycle wheels. One part of the road was densely covered with shiny metallic fragments of sheath wings, which was sad to see. I also ran into a Magcargo who was out walking at dusk on a clear day, as well as other goose-yellow mushrooms.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
