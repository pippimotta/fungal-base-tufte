This action-adventure game issued in March 2017, developed and published by Nintendo won the IGN‚Äôs Game of the Year.
It is described as ‚Äúevocative, exhilarating and a masterclass in open-world design‚Äù and the milestone in the game history. The game, just as its tile indicated, creates a wild and vast area ‚Äìthe land of &lt;em>Hyrule&lt;/em> for the players, which hides hundreds of puzzles and wonder to be found.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hiking</title><link>http://pippimotta.github.io/post/mountain_climbing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://pippimotta.github.io/post/mountain_climbing/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today I went to climb the mountain again!

I also ran into a Magcargo who was out walking at dusk on a clear day, as well as other goose-yellow mushrooms.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>http://pippimotta.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://pippimotta.github.io/about/</guid><description>Hello, this is pippimottaüçÑ.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently learning to be a backend engineer. If you happen to be curious about the reason for this part, please have a look of my self-introduction cheat sheet(which doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist for now:) I like figuring out the principles of things and explaining them in a clear way, through which the transcending harmony of self-consistent logic could come to forth.
What I&amp;rsquo;m trying to do more: keeping my dopamine at a stable level, being wary of structive inequality, exploring the potential of cyber anarchism, discovering mushrooms in the gap of capitalist world.</description></item></channel></rss>
